In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to log a summary of my life experiences and things I learnt about the world this year.
First of all, this year is one of the most enjoyable and busy years I ever had. Went from extremely negative events (which I converted into life lessons) to very much enjoyable events.</description></item><item><title>Lion and the Friend.</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/lion-and-the-friend/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 23:07:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/lion-and-the-friend/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a story. Happened in Africa.
There were 2 friends. One day they went to the jungle. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may be hungry, don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because, you know, it never told me. The problem is, this animal was approching them.
One friend got down to tie the lace of his shoe. The other asked, &amp;ldquo;what are you doing? You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a lion&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>I don't trust computers. Am I a caveman?</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/do-not-trust-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 02:51:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/do-not-trust-computers/</guid><description>My high school history teacher worked at a local bank once and he said some customers don&amp;rsquo;t trust computers. They don&amp;rsquo;t trust money counting machines. They don&amp;rsquo;t trust ATMs. They are afraid of getting less money out of them than it records. These people are mostly seniors. Internet and computers wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big thing in their ages.
Why a bank employee gave up his job for teaching kids? I don&amp;rsquo;t know but he&amp;rsquo;s not dumb either.</description></item></channel></rss>
