I tried to be a more extroverted person in the last few months last year. I was successful. Met lot of new people. Now I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my normal introverted mode. However, I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my normal introverted mode more faster than I expected. Velocity is much higher than I predicted.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.</description></item><item><title>Lion and the Friend.</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/lion-and-the-friend/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 23:07:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/lion-and-the-friend/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a story. Happened in Africa.
There were 2 friends. One day they went to the jungle. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may be hungry, don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because, you know, it never told me. The problem is, this animal was approching them.
One friend got down to tie the lace of his shoe. The other asked, &amp;ldquo;what are you doing? You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a lion&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
