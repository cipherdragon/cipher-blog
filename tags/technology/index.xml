I would not be incorrect if I say markdown will only be second to gemtext and plain .txt text files in terms of simplicity. Unfortunately, there are more people who don&amp;rsquo;t even know what markdown is than the people who know.

If you want to take some notes during a lecture or during a presentation etc, your note will mostly be plain text.</description></item><item><title>All About CLI</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/all-about-cli/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 01:28:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/all-about-cli/</guid><description>This article will be on &amp;ldquo;Command Line Interface,&amp;rdquo; (CLI in short) aka the black box hackers type into using blue or green text in movies.

Today&amp;rsquo;s the 10,640th September. People usually ask me questions related to IT, specially related to programming. Many questions are just garbage. People don&amp;rsquo;t know to ask questions the right way.
I see many of these &amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo; questions on stackoverflow. When I see them, I just leave a advice in the comments and move on, but if the question is utter garbage, I immediatly downvote. This is the same procedure many other stackoverflow users follow.</description></item><item><title>Generate QR codes quickly in linux terminal</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 20:07:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</guid><description>Recently I had to type a long password to an app, but it&amp;rsquo;s super complex that typing is a headache. Password was in my password manager on laptop I decided to transfer the password using QR codes and then copy it.
