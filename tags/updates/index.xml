I tried to be a more extroverted person in the last few months last year. I was successful. Met lot of new people. Now I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my normal introverted mode. However, I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my normal introverted mode more faster than I expected. Velocity is much higher than I predicted.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.</description></item></channel></rss>
