It is, The Fish Eye Project.
This idea is simply a camera app which will record a video and backup it to a cloud storage in real time. It&amp;rsquo;s like facebook or youtube live, but for personal purposes. Especially, privacy is preserved with encryption.
Now, for whom this app is for? For everyone. To better explain, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab an example scenario. Think of you being in a situation where you went shopping and all of a sudden, the security guard accuses you of shoplifting and demand to search you.</description></item></channel></rss>
