Terminal, console and command prompt are other common words too.
If you think there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for you to learn about CLI in 2022 because now you have glowing user interfaces, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong, you&amp;rsquo;ll only be a soydev, a sarcasm generator for the programming community.</description></item><item><title>How to Ask a Question</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/how-to-ask-a-question/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 17:39:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/how-to-ask-a-question/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s September again!
Today&amp;rsquo;s the 10,640th September. People usually ask me questions related to IT, specially related to programming. Many questions are just garbage. People don&amp;rsquo;t know to ask questions the right way.
I see many of these &amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo; questions on stackoverflow. When I see them, I just leave a advice in the comments and move on, but if the question is utter garbage, I immediatly downvote. This is the same procedure many other stackoverflow users follow.</description></item><item><title>Generate QR codes quickly in linux terminal</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 20:07:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</guid><description>Recently I had to type a long password to an app, but it&amp;rsquo;s super complex that typing is a headache. Password was in my password manager on laptop I decided to transfer the password using QR codes and then copy it.
Generating a QR is nothing hard these days, tons of online services for this now, but the thing is, my data is sensitive. Online services are not an option.</description></item></channel></rss>
