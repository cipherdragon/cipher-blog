Happened in Africa.
There were 2 friends. One day they went to jungle. Why? Don&amp;rsquo;t know, may be just to relax their minds. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may felt hunger, don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because, you know, it never told me. Anyway, the problem is, this meat eater was approching them.
