Since then
my social personality has been changed a lot. So I&rsquo;m re-writing.</p><p>I&rsquo;m Adeepa Gunathilake. Currently a BSc. Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
undergraduate. I&rsquo;m currently in the third decade of my life.</p><p>My social life is not that strong, but I must admit that I became a little bit
social in past few months. I use no social media at all. I used to use mastodon
but not much active now. This website is the only major place I participate in
the internet other than on github and stackoverflow.</p><h2 id=things-i-love-to-do>Things I love to do</h2><ul><li>Cycling</li><li>Programming</li><li>Sleeping</li><li>Spending time with my close friends</li><li>Enjoying nature</li></ul><p>Because I wasn&rsquo;t that much social, I used to spend my time at home, staring at
a computer screen, coding things. Programming is my hobby. Not just programming,
engaging in activities related to computer science rewarded me a lot of dopamine.
I spent so much hours coding unfinished useless hobby projects and learning many
things related to computer science just because it pleases my mind.</p><p><div class=md-image><img src=/img/death-rode-pale-horse-cat-on-dog.webp alt="death rode pale horse cat meme"></div></p><h2 id=youtube-channels-i-enjoy-watching>Youtube channels I enjoy watching</h2><ul><li>Fireship</li><li>LiveOverflow</li><li>ColdFusion</li><li>Aperture</li><li>Ben Eater</li><li>James Jani</li><li>Mystery Recapped</li></ul><hr><blockquote><p>All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must
seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near,
we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him
believe we are near.</p><p>Sun tzu, The Art of War</p></blockquote><p>They say knowledge is the power. That&rsquo;s true. The more you know a person, the
more you can control them.</p><p>So as you may guessed by now, some facts on this page are just disinformation.</p><p>Have a nice rest of the day!</p></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’—</h3></div></div></body></html>
