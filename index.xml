I guess only 3 days left, I don&amp;rsquo;t count. I should say, this is one of the most enjoyed years in my life. Met a handful of funny lovely new friends.
I started to write my own OS. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;ll ever be usefull. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this only for educational purpose. Now I know how to place a useful instruction on 0x07C0 memory address of the RAM and load the OS to the RAM.</description></item><item><title>All About CLI</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/all-about-cli/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 01:28:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/all-about-cli/</guid><description>This article will be on &amp;ldquo;Command Line Interface,&amp;rdquo; (CLI in short) aka the black box hackers type into using blue or green text in movies. Terminal, console and command prompt are other common words too.
If you think there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for you to learn about CLI in 2022 because now you have glowing user interfaces, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong, you&amp;rsquo;ll only be a soydev, a sarcasm generator for the programming community.</description></item><item><title>How to Ask a Question</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/how-to-ask-a-question/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 17:39:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/how-to-ask-a-question/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s September again!
Today&amp;rsquo;s the 10,640th September. People usually ask me questions related to IT, specially related to programming. Many questions are just garbage. People don&amp;rsquo;t know to ask questions the right way.
I see many of these &amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo; questions on stackoverflow. When I see them, I just leave a advice in the comments and move on, but if the question is utter garbage, I immediatly downvote. This is the same procedure many other stackoverflow users follow.</description></item><item><title>16 09 2022</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/diary/16-09-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:54:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/diary/16-09-2022/</guid><description>Why the fish move?
Fish in my fish tank move. I know, that&amp;rsquo;s the expected behavior, but why?
Apart from eating, they have no other thing to do. So why do they move. What&amp;rsquo;s going on in their heads? Are they thinking, &amp;ldquo;Oh I&amp;rsquo;ve to go there. Great, now I&amp;rsquo;m here, I&amp;rsquo;ve to go back to the previous place and come back here?&amp;rdquo;
We, humans too move. Why? At the core, we too only have those 2 things the fish do in their lives, eating and reproduction.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 03:13:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/about/</guid><description>Hello world!
Last time I wrote my about page is about 5 months ago. Since then my social personality has been changed a lot. So I&amp;rsquo;m re-writing.
I&amp;rsquo;m Adeepa Gunathilake. Currently a BSc. Artificial Intelligence and Data Science undergraduate. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the third decade of my life.
My social life is not that strong, but I must admit that I became a little bit social in past few months. I use no social media at all.</description></item><item><title>Contact Details</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 18:15:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/contact/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my contact details:

Went to the sea shore today.
Sea, as seen by someone from the shore should be the most beautiful thing on Earth. Someone who&amp;rsquo;s drowning may see it as the most dangerous place to be. A sailer sailing for months may see it as a prison. Kids playing on the shore, oh for them, it&amp;rsquo;s heaven.
Just different perspectives.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dumbcooks.com/diary/12-08-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 14:03:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/diary/12-08-2022/</guid><description>Had to repair my bicycle. Then clean up my desktop PC. I removed the processor to clean. That little circuit I hold for about 5 minutes worth more than my mother&amp;rsquo;s jwelery.
Fan above it had accumelated so much dust. Cleaned them. Processor had dust too. Blowed most of the dust but could not clean well because I don&amp;rsquo;t have proper equipment. Cleaned the RAM pins and VGA pins.
Cool, now PC works.</description></item><item><title>Generate QR codes quickly in linux terminal</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 20:07:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</guid><description>Recently I had to type a long password to an app, but it&amp;rsquo;s super complex that typing is a headache. Password was in my password manager on laptop I decided to transfer the password using QR codes and then copy it.
Generating a QR is nothing hard these days, tons of online services for this now, but the thing is, my data is sensitive. Online services are not an option.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dumbcooks.com/diary/04-08-2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 15:21:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/diary/04-08-2022/</guid><description>This is the first diary entry.

Happened in Africa.
There were 2 friends. One day they went to the jungle. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may be hungry, don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because, you know, it never told me. The problem is, this animal was approching them.
One friend got down to tie the lace of his shoe. The other asked, &amp;ldquo;what are you doing? You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a lion&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
