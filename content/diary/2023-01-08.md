What's wrong with \[web\] developers these days?

Visited a lottery result website today.  Then I left that tab open and went
for the dinner.  When I came back, I hear my laptop fans running at max rpm. A
webpage just for lottery results using 30% cpu.

What's wrong with people who write these stuff? Why they are filling internet
with inefficient bloat? Internet is almost unusable without ad blockers.

I might write a separate blog post on this.
