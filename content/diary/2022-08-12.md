Had to repair my bicycle. Then clean up my desktop PC. I removed the processor
to clean.  That little circuit I hold for about 5 minutes worth more than my
mother's jwelery. 

Fan above it had accumelated so much dust. Cleaned them. Processor had dust too.
Blowed most of the dust but could not clean well because I don't have proper
equipment. Cleaned the RAM pins and VGA pins. 

Cool, now PC works. Previously, it just gave me beeps when I started it.
