I need to get rid of the books in my room. Not the reading books, but
the ones that contain written notes. They have valuable information, but
they are annoying to keep.

I'm thinking of re-writing them in a digital format. I have my A/L Maths notes
which are very much useful. Expensive to just throw them away.
Will write them in LaTeX and then throw away. LaTeX version will stay forever.

For physics, I don't have notes. I threw the books away. I'm annoyed by physics.
It's so fun to dig into maths, but in physics, learning how forces of a body
interact with each other, nope, I'm not interested.
