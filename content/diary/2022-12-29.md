Year 2022 is almost over. I guess only 3 days left, I don't count.
I should say, this is one of the most enjoyed years in my life. Met
a handful of funny lovely new friends.

I started to write my own OS. I don't think it'll ever be usefull. I'm
writing this only for educational purpose. Now I know how to place a 
useful instruction on 0x07C0 memory address of the RAM and load the OS
to the RAM. Isn't it cool?
