Why the fish move?

Fish in my fish tank move. I know, that's the expected behavior, but why?

Apart from eating, they have no other thing to do. So why do they move. What's
going on in their heads?  Are they thinking, "Oh I've to go there. Great, now
I'm here, I've to go back to the previous place and come back here?"

We, humans too move. Why? At the core, we too only have those 2 things the fish
do in their lives, eating and reproduction. We just made the process damn
complex.
