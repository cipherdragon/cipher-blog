This is a lose attempt to encode the state of my present life into words.

I tried to be a more extroverted person in the last few months last year. I was
successful. Met lot of new people. Now I'm going back to my normal 
introverted mode. However, I'm going back to my normal introverted mode more
faster than I expected. Velocity is much higher than I predicted.

I don't know if it's a good thing. I don't care. The incidents happening around
me are not interesting to pay any care.

About personal relationships...

I now have 19 close friends, 12 from my university and 7 old friend. Also have
about 20 to 25 not so close friends and other 200+ people I just know (works
other way around too).

So now I have about 44 friends.

However, the relationship with my two cousine brothers is getting weaker and
weaker every year. Those two are the first ever friends I met in my life. When I
was younger, I enjoyed a lot of time with them. Those days, just meeting them
would make me so much happy, but I'm feeling this relationship is getting more
and more weaker now. 

About stuff happening...

I don't know what other people do in their free time, they might be consuming
tiktok, instagram etc. or might be gaming or might be chilling out with frineds
idk. When I have free time I do something related to computers. I used to do this
for a long time and now it's a habbit I can't change. 

I might be learning some new piece of obsecure garbage other people would never
think of, for example about SYN flood DDOS attacks etc. Or else, I might
build a problem my self and try to write a software to solve it. 

I however, do not play computer games. For some reason I find many computer
games boring. Last time I enjoyed a computer game was when I played Call of Duty
Modern Warfare 3. I no longer have enough computing power to play a game like
that.

However, I now find those stuff I used to do tiresome. Let's call it "computer
fatigue." I'm getting exposed to high amount of information about computer
science now than before but I'm tired to explore them now.

So there's this problem where I got tired of what I did in my free time for years
and therefore find some kind of purposelessness when I'm free. I don't know how
to solve this problem.

Going to university sucks too. It's true that I'm doing a degree related to my
favorite academic area but the things I learn at the university are either stuff
I already know or stuff I skipped researching about because I'm not interested
in. Some facts university system forces us to learn are useless garbage with
little to no real world uses. 

So far, I enjoyed learning only one module they called as "computer system
fundamentals" which is about how computers work.

So... I'm tired of computer stuff now, but because that's the only thing I know
and that's the only field I have capacity to learn, I'm kind of forced to be in 
that field by some supernatural power. It sucks!

As you can see, my life very very **un**interesting right now. When others consume
tiktok, I consume man pages. I know these states of life are temporary and 
hope for something interesting and good to happen.

Now I've to go and learn some R programming or else I have to be in a state of
confusion in the next maths lecture, but it's already past midnight so I might
just give up and sleep.

Whatever happens, it's not interesting enough to pay attention.

Thanks for reading. Have a nice rest of the day!
