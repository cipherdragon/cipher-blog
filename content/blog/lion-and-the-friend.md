Okay, here's story. Happened in Africa.

There were 2 friends. One day they went to jungle. Why? Don't know, may be just
to relax their minds. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may felt hunger,
don't know for sure because, you know, it never told me. Anyway, the problem
is, this meat eater was approching them. 

One friend get down to tie the lace of his running shoes. The other said, "what
are you doing? You can't outrun a lion". Okay, you know the rest, because this
story is popular. Anyone knows this story, but for the sake of completeness,
here's what the first friend's reply.

"I don't need to outrun a lion, I just need to outrun you."

I tell this story to everyone. I love it. Why? Don't know. Might be because the
story is too realistic.  Not in the sense whether the incident took place in
real life or not, but this story explains a typical human mind. It explains how
the world works.

Don't be skid. Peace.
