This is the end of the year (2022) and most probably, my last web log for this
year. In this blog post, I'm going to log a summary of my life experiences and
things I learnt about the world this year.

First of all, this year is one of the most enjoyable and busy years I ever had.
Went from extremely negative events (which I converted into life lessons) to very
much enjoyable events. I'm very much greatful for the beautiful friends who made
this year one of the most sweetest years.

In this year, I decided to go for a change. Actually, it happened not in the
beginning of the year but in about May I guess, after I resigned from my first
job. I decided to put my head out of the introvert shell.
This change exposed me to lot of positiveness as well as the society's cringe.
Would I go back into my introvert shell? Yes, but not completely, just partially.

To explain what I meant by "got out of the introvert shell," here's how I used to
behave earlier, before deciding to change.

I did not participate in any social events, tried to avoid them at my best. When
I did, I went full invisible mode. I remember how nobody in my physics class knew
my name even after we studied together for 2 years. That's nothing surprising 
because I didn't open up to any conversations.

If you've been with me after May 2022, you know those facts about me aren't true
anymore. That's the change I said above. This change offered me many things. First
thing is popularity. Being popular is not cringe, it's actually a powerful thing
when it comes to the job market. Second and most important thing is the beautiful
vibrant friends I made. Now beacause I've exposed to more people, I learnt how to
handle different types of people.

Then, about the cringeness of the society.

Since I decided to socialize, I started to see the dumbness in my generation.

Where to start...? Okay, here.

For many, mobile phone is an essential item in life. Mobile phone is a
dependancy of their lives. In this year, I've met a huge number of so called
"in-cells." an in-cell is a type of person who will engage in an inter-personal
interaction, let's say talking with a friend, and then when there's a pause for
about 2 seconds, in-cell takes his cell phone out and do some nonsense with it.
In-cells can't even tolorate 2 seconds of emptiness. Their brains are begging them to
check their phones. Sad thing is, this in-cell behavior has now been "normalized"
in the society.

Then comes the narcissists. When they see a mirror somewhere, they 
grab their phones out and aim at the mirror to take a so called
"mirror selfie." This is totally cringe. Why would anyone with a brain wants to
take a selfie inside a washroom? These selfies serve no purpose other than fulfilling
those people's narcissistic desires. Of course some of my friends do this too.
There's big mirror in my university's elevator. So my friends take mirror selfies
in the elevator and then post them on social media. I guess they wanted to tell
everybody that they're using the elevator. Mirrors are not the only subject
these people are targetting. Food is another subject. 

Then the social media. Especially tiktok. After I decided to be "social," I 
started to see people doing unusual stuff like weird dances etc. They say,
that's for a tiktok video. What a joke? Imagine a supernatural power took these
people to the middle of a city in 1980s while they were "producing content."
Definitely the people in 1980s would assume those time travellers have some sort
of mental disorder. 

**Mainstream** social media as of right now is garbage, but there are some
features that are more useless than the others. One such thing is "stories" in
instagram or "status" in whatsapp. Now, normies would argue otherwise, but what
actual problems do these features solve? I've seen people wishing their friends
a "happy birthday" on whatsapp status. What's the point? To tell everyone in their contacts that they wished their friend a "happy birthday?" Seems like many
don't understand what to post privately vs what to post publicly. 

Then comes the "shiny object syndrom." People with this syndrom always want the 
newest thing. Not only they want them, but once they get that, they'll tell
everybody that they bought a new shiny thing. They'll post pictures of unboxing
the newly bought item on social media. Apple fans are the best example for this.
Shiny object syndrom is cringe but also, it's very harmful to the enviroment.

The reason for all of this cringe is the people's **digital illiteracy.** People
in my generation think they are tech savy because they know how to use the 
internet, but the reality is, those people don't even know what the "internet"
is. All they know is just how to use some apps and devices others made for them.
Because these people don't know what internet is and how to use the internet, 
they depend on some big-tech corporations to use the internet. For them, their 
entire internet is a pseudo-internet companies like Google, ByteDance, Meta, Apple
and Samsung made for them. Because the modern world depends so much on computers,
society's digital illiteracy harms the world/society a lot.

So, that's it. I witnessed all these cringe since I decided to be "socialize." 
I tolorated all of this nonsense and had to unwillingly participate, but since
the year is over, I'll end up my "social experiment" and go back to my previous
state, partially. I said partially because I don't want to be completely
introverted as I used to be. I'm looking forward to enjoy my life with my friends
but also stand completely against the social cringeness I saw this year.

Again, I'm thankful for my beautiful friends for gifting me this sweet year.

Happy new year!
