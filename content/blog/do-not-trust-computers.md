My high school history teacher worked at a local bank once and he said some
customers don't trust the computers. They don't trust money counting machines.
They don't trust ATMs. They are afraid of getting less money out of that metal
machine than it records. These people are mostly seniors. Internet and computers
wasn't a big thing in their ages.

Why a bank employee gave up his job for teaching high schoold kids? I don't know
but he's not dumb either. He is way too smart.  Much smarter than me. 

Anyway, senior citizens don't trust tech because they don't understand tech.
They don't have the knowledge. That's what he says. He says humans can make
mistakes but not machines. Younger generation use the tech without a fear
because they are "educated" and they have the tech literacy.

What's your thought on this? 

Most (I mean, all) of my friends agree with him. We, the young have so much tech
literacy that we don't fear using technology like our non-techie seniors. We
know a machine won't do mistakes even though humans do. Computers are
trustworthy and that's why we use them for from war, space missions to air
traffic controlling.

Want to cook? There's a app for that. Want
to fly? An app for that. See, we have all the convenieces in life because we are
"tech-literate" than previous generations. Why bother touching switches when
the lights are smart? And alexa, google assistant, siri, you name it, all are
there to serve us.

This should summarize the way most people in my age think, but I'm the exception
here. I don't think of tech that way (that "we" in above paragraph, that don't
include "me"). 

Most think I'm weird because I don't use social media because I disagree with
their privacy policies.  What's wrong with not agreeing a privay policy? Anyway,
most tech guys, who always get impressed by the newest technology out there (new
iPhone, air tag, M1 chip etc.), they are just "tech normies." That's why
they behave like that.

Those techies want to own all the new tech but they don't even understand how
they work. Let's talk about the AirTag thing. The techies, they know how to use
the gadget. They know how to configure it, pair it with their device or
whatever... but what they don't know is how that thing works. They don't know
their apple devices are constantly talking with other apple devices owned by
random strangers via a low energy bluetooth mesh network. They don't know they
have no authority to control this and even though they switch off their devices,
the device constantly keep on talking with others until the battery goes off.

See, these people are dumb. To make things worst, they are not only dumb but
also, many of them show narcissistic behaviors.

I'll never use amazon echo, google assistant etc. I don't want to have
microphone recording everything I say and upload it to a server I don't have
control over, but the good news is, FOSS alternatives to those proprietary tech
already looks promising. Especially, projects like "Microft" are very cool. 

# Real problem with computers

But anyway, talking about the trustworthiness of computers, computers are
trustworthy. They do what we ask them to do. Just that. Write a program, throw
it on a processor and it will do what you asked it to do. Sometimes mechanical
errors pop-up but that's not a big deal.

So what's the problem here?

Can you trust the orders you issued on a computer? That's the real question.
Computers do what you ask it to do but what you asked it to do is **not** always
the thing you want it to do.

Many people don't know how to instruct computers but there are specialized
people who do only this in their whole life and they are called "programmers"

The thing is, they make lot of mistakes. Some are not even mistakes, they
intentionally write those bugs and when someone finds out later, the programmer
will usually get sued. Here are a list of mistakes that cost lives and money.

- Therac 25 incident
- Amazon's internal recruitment AI being biased
- Patriot Missile Software Failure 
- Heathrow Terminal 5 Opening software bug
- EDS Child Support System

Okay that's it.

Don't be a skid. Peace.
