Here's a story. Happened in Africa.

There were 2 friends. One day they went to the jungle.  All of a sudden, they
saw a lion. It may be hungry, don't know for sure because, you know, it never
told me. The problem is, this animal was approching them. 

One friend got down to tie the lace of his shoe. The other asked, "what are you
doing? You can't outrun a lion". Everyone knows this story, but for the sake of
completeness, here's the first friend's reply.

"I don't need to outrun a lion, I just need to outrun you."

I tell this story to everyone. I love it. Why? Don't know. It is too realistic.
Not in the sense whether the incident happened for real or not, but this story
explains a typical human mind. It explains how the world works.

Don't be skid. Peace.
