Hello world!

Last time I wrote my about page is about 5 months ago. Since then
my social personality has been changed a lot. So I'm re-writing.

I'm Adeepa Gunathilake. Currently a BSc. Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
undergraduate. I'm currently in the third decade of my life. 

My social life is not that strong, but I must admit that I became a little bit
social in past few months. I use no social media at all. I used to use mastodon
but not much active now. This website is the only major place I participate in
the internet other than on github and stackoverflow.

## Things I love to do

+ Cycling 
+ Programming 
+ Sleeping 
+ Spending time with my close friends
+ Enjoying nature

Because I wasn't that much social, I used to spend my time at home, staring at
a computer screen, coding things. Programming is my hobby. Not just programming,
engaging in activities related to computer science rewarded me a lot of dopamine.
I spent so much hours coding unfinished useless hobby projects and learning many
things related to computer science just because it pleases my mind.

+ LiveOverflow
+ ColdFusion
+ Aperture
+ Ben Eater
+ James Jani
+ Mystery Recapped

They say knowledge is the power. That's true. The more you know a person, the
more you can control them.

So as you may guessed by now, some facts on this page are just disinformation.

Have a nice rest of the day!
