I'm Adeepa Gunathilake and here's my "about" page. I don't think anyone would
even read this, but writing anyway. If you're looking to social engineer me, this
section might help you. So take notes :)

![death-rode-a-pale-horse](/img/death-rode-pale-horse-cat-on-dog-2.jpg)

I am just a curious student. I love making computers go beep boop. I was born
in mid August some year near 2000 and ever since then, I try to figure out how
this world works.  Law and justice system, economy, language and different
cultures make me scratch the curious part of my mind. I have a habbit of not
completing my hobby coding projects.

## Things I love to do

+ Sleeping 
+ Swimming 
+ Cycling 
+ Watching the sea 
+ Programming 
+ criticizing memes on reddit 
+ Spending time with my friends

About that last point: I only consider handful amount of people as my friends.
So spending time with them means spending time with that close little circle of
about 10 to 20 friendly people.

## Things I hate

+ Tiktok
+ Facebook and instagram
+ History books
+ Taking selfies
+ All people **<u>other than</u>** my family members, cousins, my teachers, my
close group of friends, people I respect and linux users.

About that last point: I don't hate people, I just simply don't like them. If
you met me in real life and my interations with you are friendly, that means you
are in the "people I respect" category.

## Youtube channels I enjoy watching

+ Fireship
+ LiveOverflow
+ ColdFusion
+ Aperture
+ Ben Eater
+ James Jani
+ Mystery Recapped

I'm a linux user so this page would be incomplete if I don't write about
software.

+ My current OS: Linux Mint (desktop) and Fedora (laptop)

## Software I love

+ vim
+ vs code
+ firefox
+ ranger
+ keepassxc
+ veracrypt
+ ffmpeg
+ brave-browser

They say knowledge is the power. That's true. The more you know a person, the
more you can control them. That's why data-mining companies like facebook,
bytedance and google control the modern world. That's the exact same reason why
we should learn to lie.

So as you may guessed by now, some facts on this page are just disinformation.

Have a nice rest of the day!
