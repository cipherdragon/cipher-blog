animation only to remove it later because brave browser on
mobile does not work well with it.</p></div><div class=diary-entry>Dec 29, 2022<div class=hr></div><p>Year 2022 is almost over. I guess only 3 days left, I don&rsquo;t count.
I should say, this is one of the most enjoyed years in my life. Met
a handful of funny lovely new friends.</p><p>I started to write my own OS. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll ever be usefull. I&rsquo;m
writing this only for educational purpose. Now I know how to place a
useful instruction on 0x07C0 memory address of the RAM and load the OS
to the RAM. Isn&rsquo;t it cool?</p></div><div class=diary-entry>Sep 16, 2022<div class=hr></div><p>Why the fish move?</p><p>Fish in my fish tank move. I know, that&rsquo;s the expected behavior, but why?</p><p>Apart from eating, they have no other thing to do. So why do they move. What&rsquo;s
going on in their heads? Are they thinking, &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ve to go there. Great, now
I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ve to go back to the previous place and come back here?&rdquo;</p><p>We, humans too move. Why? At the core, we too only have those 2 things the fish
do in their lives, eating and reproduction. We just made the process damn
complex.</p></div><div class=diary-entry>Aug 19, 2022<div class=hr></div><p>She sells sea shells on the sea shore. Went to the sea shore today.</p><p>Sea, as seen by someone from the shore should be the most beautiful thing on
Earth. Someone who&rsquo;s drowning may see it as the most dangerous place to be. A
sailer sailing for months may see it as a prison. Kids playing on the shore, oh
for them, it&rsquo;s heaven.</p><p>Just different perspectives.</p></div><div class=diary-entry>Aug 12, 2022<div class=hr></div><p>Had to repair my bicycle. Then clean up my desktop PC. I removed the processor
to clean. That little circuit I hold for about 5 minutes worth more than my
mother&rsquo;s jwelery.</p><p>Fan above it had accumelated so much dust. Cleaned them. Processor had dust too.
Blowed most of the dust but could not clean well because I don&rsquo;t have proper
equipment. Cleaned the RAM pins and VGA pins.</p><p>Cool, now PC works. Previously, it just gave me beeps when I started it.</p></div><div class=diary-entry>Aug 04, 2022<div class=hr></div><p>This is the first diary entry. Is having a diary in a personal website good?
Idk, but it&rsquo;s worth a try.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s cycling journey is cool. I covered almost 15km.</p></div><div class=ball></div><div class=diary-end>the end</div></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by üíó</h3></div></div></body></html>
