I was
successful. Met lot of new people. Now I&rsquo;m going back to my normal
introverted mode. However, I&rsquo;m going back to my normal introverted mode more
faster than I expected. Velocity is much higher than I predicted.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a good thing. I don&rsquo;t care. The incidents happening around
me are not interesting to pay any care.</p><p>About personal relationships&mldr;</p><p>I now have 19 close friends, 12 from my university and 7 old friend. Also have
about 20 to 25 not so close friends and other 200+ people I just know (works
other way around too).</p><p>So now I have about 44 friends.</p><p>However, the relationship with my two cousine brothers is getting weaker and
weaker every year. Those two are the first ever friends I met in my life. When I
was younger, I enjoyed a lot of time with them. Those days, just meeting them
would make me so much happy, but I&rsquo;m feeling this relationship is getting more
and more weaker now.</p><p>About stuff happening&mldr;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what other people do in their free time, they might be consuming
tiktok, instagram etc. or might be gaming or might be chilling out with frineds
idk. When I have free time I do something related to computers. I used to do this
for a long time and now it&rsquo;s a habbit I can&rsquo;t change.</p><p>I might be learning some new piece of obsecure garbage other people would never
think of, for example about SYN flood DDOS attacks etc. Or else, I might
build a problem my self and try to write a software to solve it.</p><p>I however, do not play computer games. For some reason I find many computer
games boring. Last time I enjoyed a computer game was when I played Call of Duty
Modern Warfare 3. I no longer have enough computing power to play a game like
that.</p><p>However, I now find those stuff I used to do tiresome. Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;computer
fatigue.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m getting exposed to high amount of information about computer
science now than before but I&rsquo;m tired to explore them now.</p><p>So there&rsquo;s this problem where I got tired of what I did in my free time for years
and therefore find some kind of purposelessness when I&rsquo;m free. I don&rsquo;t know how
to solve this problem.</p><p>Going to university sucks too. It&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;m doing a degree related to my
favorite academic area but the things I learn at the university are either stuff
I already know or stuff I skipped researching about because I&rsquo;m not interested
in. Some facts university system forces us to learn are useless garbage with
little to no real world uses.</p><p>So far, I enjoyed learning only one module they called as &ldquo;computer system
fundamentals&rdquo; which is about how computers work.</p><p>So&mldr; I&rsquo;m tired of computer stuff now, but because that&rsquo;s the only thing I know
and that&rsquo;s the only field I have capacity to learn, I&rsquo;m kind of forced to be in
that field by some supernatural power. It sucks!</p><p>As you can see, my life very very <strong>un</strong>interesting right now. When others consume
tiktok, I consume man pages. I know these states of life are temporary and
hope for something interesting and good to happen.</p><p>Now I&rsquo;ve to go and learn some R programming or else I have to be in a state of
confusion in the next maths lecture, but it&rsquo;s already past midnight so I might
just give up and sleep.</p><p>Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not interesting enough to pay attention.</p><p>Thanks for reading. Have a nice rest of the day!</p></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’—</h3></div></div></body></html>
