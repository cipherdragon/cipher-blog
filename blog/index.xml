Today&amp;rsquo;s the 10,640th September. People usually ask me questions related to IT, specially related to programming. Many questions are just garbage. People don&amp;rsquo;t know to ask questions the right way.
I see many of these &amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo; questions on stackoverflow. When I see them, I just leave a advice in the comments and move on, but if the question is utter garbage, I immediatly downvote. This is the same procedure many other stackoverflow users follow.</description></item><item><title>Generate QR codes quickly in linux terminal</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 20:07:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</guid><description>Recently I had to type a long password to an app, but it&amp;rsquo;s super complex that typing is a headache. Password was in my password manager on laptop I decided to transfer the password using QR codes and then copy it.
Generating a QR is nothing hard these days, tons of online services for this now, but the thing is, my data is sensitive. Online services are not an option.</description></item><item><title>Lion and the Friend.</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/lion-and-the-friend/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 23:07:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/lion-and-the-friend/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a story. Happened in Africa.
There were 2 friends. One day they went to the jungle. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may be hungry, don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because, you know, it never told me. The problem is, this animal was approching them.
One friend got down to tie the lace of his shoe. The other asked, &amp;ldquo;what are you doing? You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a lion&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>I don't trust computers. Am I a caveman?</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/do-not-trust-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 02:51:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/do-not-trust-computers/</guid><description>My high school history teacher worked at a local bank once and he said some customers don&amp;rsquo;t trust computers. They don&amp;rsquo;t trust money counting machines. They don&amp;rsquo;t trust ATMs. They are afraid of getting less money out of them than it records. These people are mostly seniors. Internet and computers wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big thing in their ages.
Why a bank employee gave up his job for teaching kids? I don&amp;rsquo;t know but he&amp;rsquo;s not dumb either.</description></item></channel></rss>
