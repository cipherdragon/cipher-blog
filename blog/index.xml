Just throwing out my opinions.
After the 2008 financial crisis, some people decided to create a new currency that&amp;rsquo;s not in control of government or any other central authority. The currency is controlled by the people who use it. They name that currency Bitcoin.
This currency used a genius mechanism called blockchain to create digital scarcity, which is exactly what a currency needs.</description></item><item><title>The Fish Eye Project</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/fish-eye/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 22:05:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/fish-eye/</guid><description>I want to share my new idea. It is, The Fish Eye Project.
This idea is simply a camera app which will record a video and backup it to a cloud storage in real time. It&amp;rsquo;s like facebook or youtube live, but for personal purposes. Especially, privacy is preserved with encryption.
Now, for whom this app is for? For everyone. To better explain, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab an example scenario. Think of you being in a situation where you went shopping and all of a sudden, the security guard accuses you of shoplifting and demand to search you.</description></item><item><title>Git Cheatsheet</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/git-cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 20:36:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/git-cheatsheet/</guid><description>Git is a version control system, another great invention of Linus Torvalds.

I would not be incorrect if I say markdown will only be second to gemtext and plain .txt text files in terms of simplicity. Unfortunately, there are more people who don&amp;rsquo;t even know what markdown is than the people who know.

If you want to take some notes during a lecture or during a presentation etc, your note will mostly be plain text.</description></item><item><title>All About CLI</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/all-about-cli/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 01:28:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/all-about-cli/</guid><description>This article will be on &amp;ldquo;Command Line Interface,&amp;rdquo; (CLI in short) aka the black box hackers type into using blue or green text in movies. Terminal, console and command prompt are other common words too.
If you think there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for you to learn about CLI in 2022 because now you have glowing user interfaces, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong, you&amp;rsquo;ll only be a soydev, a sarcasm generator for the programming community.</description></item><item><title>How to Ask a Question</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/how-to-ask-a-question/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 17:39:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/how-to-ask-a-question/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s September again!
Today&amp;rsquo;s the 10,640th September. People usually ask me questions related to IT, specially related to programming. Many questions are just garbage. People don&amp;rsquo;t know to ask questions the right way.
I see many of these &amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo; questions on stackoverflow. When I see them, I just leave a advice in the comments and move on, but if the question is utter garbage, I immediatly downvote. This is the same procedure many other stackoverflow users follow.</description></item><item><title>Generate QR codes quickly in linux terminal</title><link>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 20:07:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dumbcooks.com/blog/generate-qr-linux-terminal/</guid><description>Recently I had to type a long password to an app, but it&amp;rsquo;s super complex that typing is a headache.

Happened in Africa.
There were 2 friends. One day they went to the jungle. All of a sudden, they saw a lion. It may be hungry, don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because, you know, it never told me. The problem is, this animal was approching them.
One friend got down to tie the lace of his shoe. The other asked, &amp;ldquo;what are you doing? You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a lion&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
