These files hold pieces of labeled data such as username and password.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a cookie file.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1
</span><span class=lnt>2
</span><span class=lnt>3
</span></code></pre></td><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nv>username</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=s2>&#34;some random username&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nv>password</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=s2>&#34;super complex password&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nv>last_login</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=m>1675604361</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>When you close the website and revisit the site again, that site can
read the cookie file it stored earlier and apply settings you set earlier.</p><p>Web browsers have an important security feature which prevents websites from
reading cookies set by other websites. This means that a cookie set by instagram
is not visible to youtube when you visit youtube. Youtube only sees the cookies
it set.</p><p>Some common uses of cookies are,</p><ol><li>Save settings such as theme preferences.</li><li>Save account login credentials.</li><li>Analyze website usage behaviour.</li><li>Track you across websites to target ads.</li></ol><p>Last 2 points are important here. Websites do this by setting a cookie with
an identifier that can uniquely identify you. For example, <code>uid=i_354a543</code>.
By reading this unique identifier, website knows that the user who liked a cooking
video yesterday is the same user who&rsquo;s visiting the site now.</p><p>Advertising companies like google and facebook take this tracking to the next
level. They provide small [javascript] programs to web developers which
developers can put in their websites to get features like facebook share button
or google analytics.</p><p>These small programs are called &ldquo;pixels&rdquo;, tracking pixels to be specific.
They place cookies to identify users.</p><p>For example, think you visit <code>tutorialspoint.com</code> and they used facebook pixel
to provide a facebook share button. Facebook pixel can&rsquo;t see cookies set by
<code>tutorialspoint.com</code> but it can see the user identification cookie it set when
you visited facebook. So now facebook know you&rsquo;ve visited <code>tutorialspoint.com</code> and
read a article about <code>C++</code>.</p><p>Then facebook can serve you relavent ads.</p><h2 id=why-website-alert-users-that-they-use-cookies>Why website alert users that they use cookies?</h2><p>&ldquo;Web Cookie&rdquo; is something that only web developers knew about 5 years ago, but
now everybody have seen that word. That is because websites now put pop-up alerts
saying that they use cookies.</p><p>Why websites annoy users this way? Why can&rsquo;t they use cookies silently without
telling the user? Is there any technical requirement?</p><p>Of course not. There&rsquo;s no any technical requirement. Web developers can use
cookies without telling the user, &mldr;but, doing that might be illegal.</p><p>I took almost 3 paragraphs to explain how advertising companies use
cookies to invade users&rsquo; privacy and show people targetted ads. Privacy is a
human right and advertisers violate that right through online surveillance.
Cookies are a major technology advertisers using to track people. So EU
intervened.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. I don&rsquo;t know much, but I know about 3 regulations that affects
usage of web cookies.</p><ol><li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li><li>ePrivacy Directive</li><li>ePrivacy Regulation</li></ol><p>To comply with those regulations, websites should inform users about how they
use cookies and should take users consent before placing cookies in users&rsquo;
browsers.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how annoying cookie pop-ups came in.</p><p>In this website you don&rsquo;t see any cookie pop-ups. That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t use
any cookies. I don&rsquo;t have any analytics or tracking here.</p><p>EU regulations did not solve the online tracking problem. It only littered
web with annoying cookies. Thanking to those pop-ups, everyone now know something
called web cookies exist.</p><div class=hr></div><p>P.S Websites don&rsquo;t save passwords in cookies for authentication. They use
something called authentication tokens.</p><div class=hr></div><p>Here are some useful references.</p><p><a href=https://gdpr.eu/cookies/>https://gdpr.eu/cookies/</a><br><a href=https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/>https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/</a></p></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’—</h3></div></div></body></html>
