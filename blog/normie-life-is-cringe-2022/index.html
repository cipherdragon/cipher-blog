year. In this blog post, I&rsquo;m going to log a summary of my life experiences and
things I learnt about the world this year.</p><p>First of all, this year is one of the most enjoyable and busy years I ever had.
Went from extremely negative events (which I converted into life lessons) to very
much enjoyable events. I&rsquo;m very much greatful for the beautiful friends who made
this year one of the most sweetest years.</p><p>In this year, I decided to go for a change. Actually, it happened not in the
beginning of the year but in about May I guess, after I resigned from my first
job. I decided to put my head out of the introvert shell.
This change exposed me to lot of positiveness as well as the society&rsquo;s cringe.
Would I go back into my introvert shell? Yes, but not completely, just partially.</p><p>To explain what I meant by &ldquo;got out of the introvert shell,&rdquo; here&rsquo;s how I used to
behave earlier, before deciding to change.</p><p>I did not participate in any social events, tried to avoid them at my best. When
I did, I went full invisible mode. I remember how nobody in my physics class knew
my name even after we studied together for 2 years. That&rsquo;s nothing surprising
because I didn&rsquo;t open up to any conversations.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been with me after May 2022, you know those facts about me aren&rsquo;t true
anymore. That&rsquo;s the change I said above. This change offered me many things. First
thing is popularity. Being popular is not cringe, it&rsquo;s actually a powerful thing
when it comes to the job market. Second and most important thing is the beautiful
vibrant friends I made. Now beacause I&rsquo;ve exposed to more people, I learnt how to
handle different types of people.</p><p>Then, about the cringeness of the society.</p><p>Since I decided to socialize, I started to see the dumbness in my generation.</p><p>Where to start&mldr;? Okay, here.</p><p>For many, mobile phone is an essential item in life. Mobile phone is a
dependancy of their lives. In this year, I&rsquo;ve met a huge number of so called
&ldquo;in-cells.&rdquo; an in-cell is a type of person who will engage in an inter-personal
interaction, let&rsquo;s say talking with a friend, and then when there&rsquo;s a pause for
about 2 seconds, in-cell takes his cell phone out and do some nonsense with it.
In-cells can&rsquo;t even tolorate 2 seconds of emptiness. Their brains are begging them to
check their phones. Sad thing is, this in-cell behavior has now been &ldquo;normalized&rdquo;
in the society.</p><p>Then comes the narcissists. When they see a mirror somewhere, they
grab their phones out and aim at the mirror to take a so called
&ldquo;mirror selfie.&rdquo; This is totally cringe. Why would anyone with a brain wants to
take a selfie inside a washroom? These selfies serve no purpose other than fulfilling
those people&rsquo;s narcissistic desires. Of course some of my friends do this too.
There&rsquo;s big mirror in my university&rsquo;s elevator. So my friends take mirror selfies
in the elevator and then post them on social media. I guess they wanted to tell
everybody that they&rsquo;re using the elevator. Mirrors are not the only subject
these people are targetting. Food is another subject.</p><p>Then the social media. Especially tiktok. After I decided to be &ldquo;social,&rdquo; I
started to see people doing unusual stuff like weird dances etc. They say,
that&rsquo;s for a tiktok video. What a joke? Imagine a supernatural power took these
people to the middle of a city in 1980s while they were &ldquo;producing content.&rdquo;
Definitely the people in 1980s would assume those time travellers have some sort
of mental disorder.</p><p><strong>Mainstream</strong> social media as of right now is garbage, but there are some
features that are more useless than the others. One such thing is &ldquo;stories&rdquo; in
instagram or &ldquo;status&rdquo; in whatsapp. Now, normies would argue otherwise, but what
actual problems do these features solve? I&rsquo;ve seen people wishing their friends
a &ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; on whatsapp status. What&rsquo;s the point? To tell everyone in their contacts that they wished their friend a &ldquo;happy birthday?&rdquo; Seems like many
don&rsquo;t understand what to post privately vs what to post publicly.</p><p>Then comes the &ldquo;shiny object syndrom.&rdquo; People with this syndrom always want the
newest thing. Not only they want them, but once they get that, they&rsquo;ll tell
everybody that they bought a new shiny thing. They&rsquo;ll post pictures of unboxing
the newly bought item on social media. Apple fans are the best example for this.
Shiny object syndrom is cringe but also, it&rsquo;s very harmful to the enviroment.</p><p>The reason for all of this cringe is the people&rsquo;s <strong>digital illiteracy.</strong> People
in my generation think they are tech savy because they know how to use the
internet, but the reality is, those people don&rsquo;t even know what the &ldquo;internet&rdquo;
is. All they know is just how to use some apps and devices others made for them.
Because these people don&rsquo;t know what internet is and how to use the internet,
they depend on some big-tech corporations to use the internet. For them, their
entire internet is a pseudo-internet companies like Google, ByteDance, Meta, Apple
and Samsung made for them. Because the modern world depends so much on computers,
society&rsquo;s digital illiteracy harms the world/society a lot.</p><p>So, that&rsquo;s it. I witnessed all these cringe since I decided to be &ldquo;socialize.&rdquo;
I tolorated all of this nonsense and had to unwillingly participate, but since
the year is over, I&rsquo;ll end up my &ldquo;social experiment&rdquo; and go back to my previous
state, partially. I said partially because I don&rsquo;t want to be completely
introverted as I used to be. I&rsquo;m looking forward to enjoy my life with my friends
but also stand completely against the social cringeness I saw this year.</p><p>Again, I&rsquo;m thankful for my beautiful friends for gifting me this sweet year.</p><p>Happy new year!</p></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’—</h3></div></div></body></html>
