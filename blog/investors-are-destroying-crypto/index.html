that&rsquo;s not in control of government or any other central authority. The currency
is controlled by the people who use it. They named it Bitcoin.</p><p>The core idea behind bitcoin, a user controlled currency, is a great idea. No
central authority to impose rules on users, but if all users decide to change,
they can (through forking). It&rsquo;s the democracy at its best.</p><p>Bitcoin used a genius mechanism called blockchain to create digital
scarcity. A currency needs to be scarce. Otherwise, it can&rsquo;t hold any value.
Combining different concepts of cryptography to create digital scarcity is a
genius idea.</p><p>It has many flaws though. Scalability, privacy concerns and so on. are widely
discussed. So I&rsquo;ll not discuss them here. Main problem I see in BTC is its
inability to adjust the money supply to match the economy.</p><p>Government controlled money has its own mechanisms to deal with inflation and
deflation. Print money to fight deflation, increase interest rates to fight
inflation etc. But Bitcoin only has a predetermined supply.</p><p>For this article, implementation details and individual currency names don&rsquo;t
matter. I&rsquo;m just going to say why crypto in its current state will never going
to succeed as a currency. I&rsquo;ll describe how greedy investors destroyed crypto.
This is just my opinion.</p><div class=hr></div><p>Many people say government issued money is solely based on trust, the trust
people put on the government. When government prints a 100LKR note and state it
values 100LKR, people believe it.</p><p>This idea is mentioned as a way to convince people why crypto is better than
government issued money. Ironically, this story is the same for crypto too. Crypto
has that value because people believe it has that value. Even for a limited
resource like gold, other than being attractive due to its rareness and shiny
nature, it has no use except for electronics and chemical experiments.</p><p>The saying that &ldquo;government issued money is based on trust&rdquo; is not a completely
valid statement. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that when I see a 100LKR note, I believe it has
a value of, well, 100LKR. But what is 100LKR?. Just like meters and kilograms,
LKR is just a unit and 100 is how much of that unit I have.</p><p>So, what gives that unit a value? It&rsquo;s the economy made by people using that
currency.</p><h3 id=how-does-currency-get-its-value>How does currency get its value</h3><p>Think of a small economy in which the only commodities dealt with
are bread and pencils. The Only citizens living here are a baker and a pencil maker.
The baker produces 10 breads per day, but the pencil maker only makes 1.</p><p>So naturally, 10 breads are worth 1 pencil.</p><p>Now imagine they started using money. The transaction of 10 breads for 1 pencil is
now worth 100LKR. Therefore, 1 bread is worth 10LKR and 1 pencil is worth 100LKR.</p><p>Now imagine a new pencil maker comes to the town and starts making 19 pencils per
day. Hence the total pencil production per day is 20. Now, the transaction of
10 breads for 20 pencils is the value of 100LKR. So now, still a bread costs
10LKR but a pencil is now only 5LKR. All of a sudden with a 100LKR note, baker
can afford more pencils. Deflation!</p><p>Notice here that there was no government or money controlling body. No one said
a pencil is worth this much and a bread is worth this much. (I set the initial
price, but then value of LKR adjusted itself to the economy).</p><p>That&rsquo;s why the statement &ldquo;Government-issued currency is based on trust&rdquo; is not
completely true. It&rsquo;s not false either; it&rsquo;s just a half truth.</p><p><strong>A single unit of government issued currency represents a tiny fraction of the
entire economy that currency is used in.</strong></p><p>Now let&rsquo;s see how crypto works.</p><h3 id=how-crypto-get-its-value>How crypto get its value</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a crypto currency called ABC. Originally, authors wanted to
make this a replacement to government-issued currency. They managed to get a
enthusiastic user base.</p><p>But one day, let&rsquo;s called it the ABC Pizza day, a pizza shop accepted 10,000 ABC
coins for a single pizza. This is a huge deal. From now on, ABC is not just a
hobby currency. Now 1 ABC is worth 0.0001 pizza. The day a ABC user bought pizza
with ABC, ABC became a real currency because it got a place in the economy.</p><p>Some greedy investors saw this. They thought, &ldquo;oh wow, if every pizza shop
starts accepting ABC, the value of ABC coin goes up because the supply of ABC
currency is capped to 21 million&rdquo;.</p><p>So they started buying ABC planning to sell when the price goes up. Because
they bought a huge amount of ABC but the supply of ABC coins is limited, the
price went up. Other greedy investors saw the price going up and started buying
so they can sell later and make some profit.</p><p>However, still, no new pizza shop started accepting ABC coins. But somehow,
the price is going up. How? If ABC is not backed by a real economy, from which
the value of ABC is backed by?</p><p>Well, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>Hope</strong>&rdquo;. Hope that one day ABC price will go to the moon.</p><p>Will that ever happen? Maybe ABC will one day worth a lot, but it&rsquo;s not a
constant price hike. It&rsquo;s a bubble. It will burst. If an investor sells their ABC
coins to someone else for a profit, the new investor is buying it for the same
reason: to sell later for a profit.</p><p>These investors are living in a real economy. There&rsquo;s a level this real economy
can bear the bubble. When it reaches that level, the bubble will burst. When
new investors stop buying into the scheme, when people don&rsquo;t buy into this
&ldquo;<em>hope</em>&rdquo; thing, the price will collapse.</p><p>Would ABC ever have a real economic value? It might not. Do you want to accept a
currency which is just backed by <em>hope</em> instead of real assets and services?</p><p>It is very less likely that the ABC currency will ever have a real economic
value.</p><h3 id=gambling-vs-investing>Gambling vs Investing</h3><blockquote><p>When you invest, you buy a physical asset that can produce goods or services.
When you gamble, you&rsquo;re just looking for suckers. As a seasoned poker player,
I can tell you that everyone thinks they&rsquo;re a graet player when they&rsquo;re on a
winning streak.</p><p>&ndash; <cite>@ilya475 (youtube comment)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Above comments sums up the current state of crypto investing. In crypto, people
are not buying to something backed by real world value such as stocks. They are
buying into the hope.</p><p>If you make profit by selling your crypto, it&rsquo;s just because you found a loser.
May be that other guy is not the looser, but eventually someone will be. That
original investor got his profit from that &ldquo;someone,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;someone&rdquo;
unfortunately, could not find &ldquo;another one&rdquo; to sell his crypto. So he lost.</p><h3 id=dont-destroy-crypto-please>Don&rsquo;t destroy crypto please</h3><p>My point is, &ldquo;the investors are destroying crypto&rdquo;.</p><p>ABC coin started to gain value after a pizza shop accepted it. That&rsquo;s how crypto
should gain value. Then ABC coin got destroyed becaused some investors started
stock piling ABC (They call it HODL) and falsely inflated the price. Now ABC
will never ever be a real currency.</p><p>I think investors broke currencies like BTC. From my very
little knowledge, I think the only currency that&rsquo;s not broken is Nano and of
course, monero. I hardly see people stock piling monero. Nano managed to burst
the bubble and survive. Big investors holding Nano lost. Now a nano
coin only worth around a dollar. After the big burst, no investor is really
buying into nano. But you know who&rsquo;s buying? The real users of Nano. Mostly
gamers to buy in game items. Nano is acting like a currency now.</p><p>I think monero also would survive the fight against greedy crypto investors.
However to succeed, it needs to have inflation/deflation controlling mechanisms.</p><p>In the bread and pencil example, price of pencils went down. If another baker
comes to the town, price of bread will also go down. This is deflation. If this
is a developing towm, this will happen constantly. Then people get the idea that
this town&rsquo;s currency will worth more tomorrow than today. So they will hold
on-to their money. It&rsquo;s fine for real world, because you&rsquo;re forced to spend on
essentials, but for crypto, this destroys the currency.</p><p>When the government of the town prints more money to fight against deflation.
prices stay steady. Fighting inflation is harder than that. The only ways my
stupid brain knows as of now is to increase interest rates.</p><p>In conclusion, if a crypto has proper mechanisms to fight inflation and
also deflation, then investors won&rsquo;t put their money into it. Only real users would
use it.</p><p>In my opinion, if someone could fill the research gap of fighting deflation
and inflation in crypto in a DeFi manner, that day, crypto will be a real.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>As of now, crypto is heavily suffering from deflation. Solving deflation is easy
as printing more money, but doing this in a decentralized and automated manner,
matching to the currency&rsquo;s economy is the real challenge.</p><p>These challenges are not yet solved.</p><p>Initial philosophy of crypto is great. But it&rsquo;s not yet achieved. To save existing
currencies from being destroyed, don&rsquo;t invest. Use them to buy stuff. If you have a
online store, accept currencies like monero instead of HODLing it.</p><p>I hope one day above challenges will be solved and crypto will be a real currency.</p></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by 💗</h3></div></div></body></html>
