Had to read the hugo manual to figure out out to write a new one. Anyway&mldr;</p><p>I want to share my new idea. It is, <strong>The Fish Eye Project</strong>.</p><p>This idea is simply a camera app which will record a video and backup it to a
cloud storage in real time. It&rsquo;s like facebook or youtube live, but for personal
purposes. Especially, privacy is preserved with encryption.</p><p>Now, for whom this app is for? It&rsquo;s for everyone. To better explain, I&rsquo;ll grab
an example scenario. Think of you being in a situation where you went shopping
and all of a sudden, the security guard accuse you of shoplifting and demand to
search you. You obviously didn&rsquo;t shoplift. Due to the guard being physically fit
than you, you can&rsquo;t do anything against them, but if you could record the
situation, it might help you in future.</p><p>So you starts recording only to get the recording deleted by the guard, or if
you are too unlucky, he may even destroy your phone entirely. Lucky for me, I&rsquo;ve
never being through such a situation, but I&rsquo;ve heard of many. There&rsquo;s a very
real possiblity something like this could happen to you or to me.</p><p>Fish Eye tries to solve this problem by uploading the footage to cloud in real
time. The only solutions as of now to this as far as I know are those live
streams provided by social media, but the usecase of that feature stands for
completely different thing. It&rsquo;s not for recording evidences. That&rsquo;s why I
decided to build this app.</p><p>Main features I have in my mind are,</p><ul><li>Real time backup to cloud (functional requirement)</li><li>Encryption (functional requirement)</li><li>Seperate password to delete the video (functional requirement)</li><li>Dead-man&rsquo;s timer (non-functional requirement)</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ll explain each briefly.</p><h3 id=real-time-backup-to-cloud>Real time backup to cloud</h3><p>I don&rsquo;t think I have to explain this in deep. I don&rsquo;t know how to do this right
now, but I assume I have to record video in chucks, let&rsquo;s say in 30 second
chunks, then encrypt it and upload it to cloud. I&rsquo;ll mention about encryption
later.</p><h3 id=encryption>Encryption</h3><p>Encryption gives user the chance to trust the server operators. Also, it makes
sure video will be safe from bad actors. Each video coming to the server is
encrypted. I&rsquo;m planning to implement a signing mechanism. In short, video chunk
is not just encrypted, but signed with the private key of the user so that the
server can check the signature and decide whether to accept the chunk or it&rsquo;s
just a spam data packet sending by a DDOS attacker. With the signature
mechanism, it&rsquo;s possible to verify the user account without something lik an
access token.</p><h3 id=seperate-password-to-delete-the-video>Seperate password to delete the video</h3><p>This is important. If the aggressor in above mentioned senario can just grab the
phone and get an access token or a password which gives full controll over the
video, whole purpose of the app will be defeated. So, I&rsquo;m planning to implement
a seperate password to delete the video. This password will be asked when the
user tries to delete the video. User is supposed to keep this password a secret
so the video will not get deleted by unintended people.</p><h3 id=dead-mans-timer>Dead man&rsquo;s timer</h3><p>Assume the user is in a dangerous situation. I corrupted police officer arrest
him and take him away illegally without informing anyone and just torture him.
Even though the authenticity is unknown, I heard these kind of stories on social
media during 2022 in Sri Lanka, during the protest period.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where the deadman&rsquo;s timeer comes in handy. User can set a timer, let&rsquo;s
say 10 hours. If the timer is activated, it&rsquo;ll send a notification to the user&rsquo;s
trusted contacts that the user is recorded a video. It&rsquo;s the user&rsquo;s
responsibility to inform the contact already the decryption password of the
encrypted video. The timer will trigger as soon as the user stops recording.</p><p>User can manually turn off the timer before the timer triggers.</p><div class=hr></div><p>I think the server only needs to accept any encrypted blob, check it&rsquo;s signature
and save it in the respective folder and also implement other functionalities
like deleting the video, etc. I think the client side is more complicated.</p><p>Client side is responsible to record the video, encrypt it, sign it and upload.
Also it&rsquo;s the client&rsquo;s responsibility process all chunks and merge them into a
single video since the server only accepts encrypted blobs. It&rsquo;s the client who
has access to the decrypted content.</p><p>For now, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ll update as I progress.</p><p>If anyone wants to contribute, please contact me. Email is in my contact page.
If you know me in real life, you might also have my phone number. Just text
then.</p></div><div class=hr></div><div class=commenting><h3>Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’—</h3></div></div></body></html>
